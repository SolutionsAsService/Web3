ByzantineFault:
  description: "A Byzantine fault is a condition in computer systems, particularly in distributed computing, where components may fail with inconsistent information regarding their state."
  origin:
    name: "Byzantine Generals Problem"
    context: "An allegory developed to describe a scenario where system actors must agree on a strategy to avoid catastrophic failure, despite some actors being unreliable."
  challenges:
    - "Inconsistencies: A component, like a server, may appear both failed and functioning to different observers."
    - "Consensus: Difficult to achieve as it requires unanimous agreement on the state of a component among all others, despite having imperfect information."
    - "Fault Detection: Failure-detection systems struggle to accurately identify whether a component has actually failed."
  impact:
    catastrophicFailureRisk: "High risk if no consensus is reached, leading to potential system-wide failures."
  solutions:
    ByzantineFaultTolerance:
      description: "BFT is a property of a distributed computing system that enables it to withstand Byzantine faults."
      methods:
        - "Replication: Duplicating components to ensure at least one functions correctly despite others failing."
        - "Consensus Protocols: Algorithms designed to achieve reliable consensus in the presence of faulty or malicious components, such as PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)."
        - "State Machine Replication: Ensures that all correct nodes in the distributed system agree on the order of operations to be applied to the state of the replicated machine."
